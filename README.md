# Rackem
Windows 11 Utility Tool, Version 1

Rackem begins as a school project to learn more about Powershell scripting and XAML. It intends to automate system tools to maintain performance of a Windows 11 system, as well as providing utility tools to customize the user's experience of the operating system. I plan on working on this for years to come, but right now this is the start. 

Please note that your execution policy will need to be changed in order to run rackem.ps1
